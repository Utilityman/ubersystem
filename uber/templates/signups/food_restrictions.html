<h2> Dietary Restrictions </h2>

{% if attendee.badge_type == c.GUEST_BADGE %}
We feed our guests three meals per day during {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, and our chefs have an easier time planning meals
when they know what kind of food restrictions everyone has.
{% else %}
Thanks for volunteering, welcome to the fold! Please let us know any dietary restrictions or allergies below.
<br/> Volunteers who have met hour requirements for food will be served 3 meals a day and have access to staff suite 24 hours a day!

<br/> <br/><strong>We do not cook with dairy, corn, or seafood. Food with gluten or egg will always have alternatives.</strong>

    Let us know if you have any other allergies or restrictions,
    please use commas to separate each allergy and food restriction.

    [1] We understand that there are different types of vegetarians/vegans, but due to the amounts and restrictions we have to cook, we cannot accommodate all types. All vegan options would also be vegatarian.
